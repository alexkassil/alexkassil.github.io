## Rush 00 (Day 5)

First group project! For this project my three team members and I had to construct a variable width/height box from the given values. It was very straight forward, with 5 different versions available. Once you completed the first, you could go on and complete the rest for extra credit, which my group did. We will be corrected by the cadets instead of the other pisciners for this.

Also today I spent most of the Day working on Sastantua. It's hard but I am making progress.
