What a day. I got to the campus at 8:25 am for the check in, and I left at 11:25 pm. It was a day full of fun, programming, and new friends!

## Check In
After getting there at 8:25, I sat around in the check-in area until 8:42 when a few quick speakers came to give us words of encouragement and info about certain logistics. Overall there were about 300 people present at the check in.

Then we were filtered upstairs where our photos were taken, our accounts activated, and we sat down to code. This all took about an hour.

## Field Notes
Throughout the day I documented each of the exercises as I worked through them. Enjoy my field notes!
