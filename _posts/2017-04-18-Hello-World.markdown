title: "Hello World!"
---
Welcome to my very first blog post! I am very _very_ excited to get my ideas out to the world.

### Plan for this blog

I have been putting quite a bit of thought into what I wan't and don't want for this blog.

##### What this blog __won't__ be
* Political or religious
* Hateful or bigoted
* Random thoughts and half-assed posts

##### What this blog (hopefully) __will__ be
* Compendium of pre-college, college, and post-college experiences as a programmer and person
* Quality guides and resources on different subjects
* Collections of my projects/ideas
* Thoughtful reflections

With this first post, I just want to thank some influencial bloggers. [Cal Newport](calnewport.com/blog/), [Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/), [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html), and [Matt Might](http://matt.might.net/articles/) are all amazing bloggers about Computer Science, life, being a student, excelling, plus other interesting applicable topics. You should check them all out. __BE WARNED__ While each blog is an amazing resource, they are all also amazing time sinks.
