After hours and hours of work, I submitted my first project, Sustantua.

## Sastantua (Day 6)
Sastantua is quite the project. One has to construct a pyramid with access to only one function, putchar, which calls only one function, write, from the unistd library. Lots of logic went into this project, and after about 10 hours of work I finished it _hopefully_ correctly.

Link to the project [here].

This project was crazy. With the limitations of only five 25 line functions, excluding putchar, one had to construct a variable sized pyramid with a door. First you are just given a binary with the executable that you have to use to calculate the patterns to turn into code. Out of the ~100 - ~50 pisciners left many didn't even finish the project. According to someone from an old piscine in France, no one passed Sastantua. We will see my fate tomorrow.
