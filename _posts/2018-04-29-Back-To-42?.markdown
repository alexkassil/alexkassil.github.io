I've been loving my first year at UC Berkeley, which I plan to detail in a different post. One thing I've missed is the intense focus on programming I had at 42. During the piscine, I had a single goal in mind - programming. Here there are clubs and classes and people and many other distractions. It's really great, but I miss the hardcore nature of programming at 42.

And so I've started again working on libft. I am confident I can finish it within the next couple of days, get it corrected at 42, and maybe keep the connection open and continue doing something small, partime at 42. I'll be busy this summer interning, but maybe I'll come during the weekends, and then come more often during my sophomore year. We shall see. All I know is I'm going to give it a damn good try.
